# Scrum Framework Poster
This poster gives you an overview of the Scrum Framework. The poster is up to date with the [2020 release of the Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org).
If you look closely, you see all QR-codes on the poster. These QR-codes will link you to a website with more information about the content. For now we have linked all the codes to our website www.scrumfacilitators.nl.

# Miro template
In collaboration with Yellow Intelligent, we provide you the Miro template including a description of how to facilitate this exercise (in Dutch)

#Special Design Thanks
Special thanks to our designer Jenny Yung. The poster came to life in close collaboration with the entire crew, but wouldn't be what it is without Jenny's illustrations, ideas and flexibility.
